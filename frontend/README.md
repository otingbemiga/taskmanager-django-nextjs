# Task Manager — Django + Next.js

This repository contains a Django backend (API) and a Next.jsfrontend implementing a simple Task Manager for the Full-Stack Mini Feature Assessment.

I have inform the HR at the cause of the first interview before this state that I only know a bit of Laravel. 

That is why I implement Django + Nextjs in this mini Task Manager Project
